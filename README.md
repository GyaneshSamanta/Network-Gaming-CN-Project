# Project Description
In the 5th semester at SRM University we had to make a project on computer networks. Following our work on the project `Distanza` from previous sem, we would be working on `Network gaming: Performance and traffic modelling`

## Abstract ‚öú

There are several different types of games that are played in multiplayer mode over networks. The
type of network games that, from a network‚Äôs perspective, are the most demanding is real-time
based multiplayer games. Users of such games both assume and require that game play interaction
happens in near real-time and these games often support a large number of simultaneous players.
Most networks are specialized to either voice traffic (such as the first and second generation of
mobile networks) or data traffic (such as wired data networks). It is not clear that the requirements
for such real time games can always be met on either type of network. The core of this thesis
investigates the performance requirements real-time multiplayer games place on packet switched
data networks and the connection between network impairments and game quality degradation.
Traffic generated by network games distinguishes itself from other traffic both regarding its
general characteristics and the requirements it places on the network. Understanding these traffic
characteristics, requirements, and what consequences failures to support such requirements entail
are of great importance when designing new networks in order to guarantee suitable quality of
service for such real-time games.

## Background üìñ

Until recently telecommunication networks have been optimized only for voice communication.
The wired network infrastructure, as used by Internet, is optimized for data transfer. Wireless
wide area cellular networks were also initially optimized for voice communication, but are also
moving more and more towards data communications. Today data traffic appears in mobile
networks and voice traffic in the wired packet switched networks (e.g. Voice over IP). Formerly
handsets for mobile networks were voice-centric, but today more advanced cell phones have
significant support for data due to the advanced services data makes possible. As a result of this
development data-traffic‚Äôs share of the next generation of mobile networks is predicted to rise.
According to several sources the mobile gaming revenues in North America will be
worth 1200 million dollars and for Western Europe 2700 million dollars. The fastest growth of online gaming
is predicted to take place in Asia and the Pacific . It is not only the gaming industries that
make profit from mobile gaming; it will also drive transport revenues for mobile carriers and
create a need for gaming enabled terminals.
Traffic generated by online games generally distinguishes itself from other Internet traffic today
both in its characteristics and in its requirements on the network. In some ways game traffic has
similar requirements to voice traffic, but will still have different traffic characteristics.
Since the game traffic characteristics differs between the different game genres it is not a trivial
task to come up with a general traffic model that could be applied to all existing or up-coming
games. Network impairments that are relevant to all types of online games are high latency,
packet loss, and reordered packets. These problems can, and most certainly will, once the
impairments reach a certain point, negatively impact the end user‚Äôs perception of the game
quality. Since in the end, the crucial issue is the end user‚Äôs perception of the gaming experience, it
is of great interest to avoid exceeding these thresholds. This thesis will only study a specific,
carefully chosen, genre of games that have the highest performance demands on the network, i.e.
real-time multiplayer games.
 A key question is if online gaming popularity will continue to grow given today‚Äôs ‚Äúlowperformance‚Äù wide area cellular network(s).

 ## Objectives

 ‚Ä¢ Analyze factors affecting network gaming performance by describing what requirements
various types of network games put on terminals, networks, and services. Included is also
an assessment of what the minimum performance requirements are for a cellular network
in order to support such gaming.
‚Ä¢ Construct a network gaming traffic model based on, preferably, several traffic traces from
representative network games. This includes an appropriate model general enough to
carry over to any popular network game, along with parameter values based on the
specific traces analyzed.
‚Ä¢ A study of the network gaming market including the size (number of players and
revenues), structure, and if possible how to classify network gamers (i.e., are these
distinct classes of gamers). What is the willingness of each class to pay for network
gaming? Is this class strong enough to drive network performance demands?
